What this project is
- A collection of utilities and helper scripts designed to augment Cubase Pro with focused capabilities for score editing, VST Expression data handling, and audio alignment. The intent is to reduce repetitive tasks, improve timing accuracy, and give users more expressive power when shaping the final mix.
- The tools are designed to integrate with standard Cubase workflows. They do not replace Cubase, but they extend what you can accomplish inside it. The goal is to keep things simple, fast, and reliable.
- This project emphasizes clear, maintainable code, small, well-documented features, and practical usage. Each component has a specific purpose and a straightforward setup process.

Core goals and design principles
- Clarity first: simple interfaces that reveal what they do and why.
- Stability: conservative changes that preserve your current Cubase session state.
- Non-destructive workflows: most tools operate in a way that leaves original data intact until you approve changes.
- Predictable results: deterministic behavior with explicit outputs and logs.
- Extensibility: a clean architecture that supports future enhancements without breaking existing setups.
- Open collaboration: easy for contributors to propose improvements, share presets, and contribute examples.
- Accessibility: friendly for both seasoned users and newcomers to Cubase Pro.

The toolset components
- Pro Score Editor helper: streamlines common score editing tasks in the Cubase Score Editor. It speeds up note entry, layout adjustments, and score-to-MPM alignment checks.
- VST Expression manager: helps you inspect, edit, and synchronize VST Expression data across tracks. It enables bulk edits, automated mapping, and per-voice expression shaping without manual clicking.
- Audio Align toolkit: supports tight alignment between audio regions and MIDI or score data. It provides practical alignment modes, snapping controls, and batch alignment options for large sessions.
- Preset library: a growing set of ready-to-use presets for common genres and workflows. Presets cover articulation mappings, expression curves, and alignment strategies.

How it fits into Cubase Pro
- The tools are designed to be used inside Cubase Pro. They respect your session, tracks, and plugin configurations.
- The score tools operate on the Score Editor layer, offering non-destructive guidance and optional changes you can apply in bulk.
- Expression management focuses on VST Expression data that accompanies MIDI and instrument tracks. You can map, edit, and harmonize articulation and dynamics across multiple tracks.
- Alignment utilities run against your audio and MIDI data, enabling precise timing corrections without re-creating performances from scratch.
- The workflow philosophy is to reduce bottlenecks. You can do more in fewer steps, with fewer context switches between tools.

Getting started
- Before you begin, ensure you have a recent version of Cubase Pro installed and a working project you're comfortable modifying.
- Download the installer from the Releases page. From the Releases page, download the installer file and run it to install the tools. This step keeps your Cubase setup consistent with the tooling.
- After installation, launch Cubase Pro and navigate to the new tools panel or menu entries added by the suite. Each tool exposes a set of options, a concise help panel, and keyboard shortcuts to speed your work.
- Start with a small test project. Create a MIDI track, a few notes in the Score Editor, and a short audio clip. Open the VST Expression editor, and experiment with a couple of articulations to see how they map to your instrument.

Installation and setup
- Prerequisites
  - Cubase Pro installed and licensed
  - A test project with MIDI data and some audio tracks
  - Administrative access for installing software on your machine
- Installing the tools
  - Step 1: Visit the Releases page at the link above to obtain the latest installer.
  - Step 2: Run the installer and follow the on-screen prompts. The installer will place components in the standard Cubase plugin and script directories.
  - Step 3: Launch Cubase Pro. The tools should register with the environment automatically. If not, restart Cubase and verify the plugin manager or script loader references.
  - Step 4: Open a project and verify that the new panels and menus appear. You should see a “Cubase Tools” section in the Workflows area and new options in the Score Editor, VST Expression, and Audio Alignment panels.
- Setup tips
  - Define your preferred shortcuts early. The tools respect user-defined keyboard maps. Assign keys to the most frequent actions, such as aligning notes, editing articulations, or applying an expression curve.
  - Create a small preset library. Start with one or two articulation sets and one alignment profile. You can expand this library over time as you encounter new tasks.
  - Test with different instrument tracks. VST Expression often maps differently across instruments. Validate how articulation switches map to your synths or sample libraries.

The philosophy of use
- Begin with a clear goal for each session. Do you need tighter alignment, more expressive articulation, or a faster score editing cycle? Choose the tool that directly supports that goal.
- Keep changes reversible. When you apply an adjustment, preserve a previous state that you can revert to if needed. This helps you explore without risking a messy project.
- Learn the defaults first. The tools include sensible defaults that work for many common workflows. Mastering the defaults yields fast results.

Typical workflows
- Score editing optimization
  - Open the Score Editor for a MIDI part.
  - Use the Pro Score Editor helper to normalize note spacing and readable layout.
  - Apply a quick articulation set to convey musical intent at a glance.
  - Export a clean score view for orchestration notes or lead sheets.
- VST Expression shaping
  - Load the VST Expression panel for your instrument track.
  - Inspect articulation events and listen to how they sound in context.
  - Apply bulk edits to expression parameters to balance the performance across a bar or section.
  - Save a preset for a given instrument, then apply it to other similar tracks.
- Audio alignment
  - Align audio regions to match the MIDI or score timing.
  - Use a guided alignment mode to correct timing drifts while preserving the natural performance.
  - Run a batch alignment across multiple sections or tracks for consistency.
  - Compare before/after waveforms to ensure the perceived timing improvement.
- End-to-end example
  - Create a piano track with MIDI notes representing a melody.
  - Open the Score Editor and ensure the notation is readable.
  - Add a VST Expression mapping for dynamics and articulation on the same track.
  - Import a vocal or instrument audio clip and align it to MIDI timing.
  - Fine-tune articulation changes to match the vocal phrase shape and groove.

Advanced workflows and automation
- Automation-friendly articulation curves
  - Use per-note articulation curves to simulate expressive phrasing. Automate these curves and apply them to similar passages.
- Expression templates
  - Create reusable templates for common parts, such as legato strings or staccato brass. Apply templates to new tracks to accelerate production.
- Batch processing
  - Run batch operations for archiving, exporting, or re-mapping expressions. This is ideal for large sessions with many tracks.
- Non-destructive experimentation
  - Try different alignment presets and compare results side by side. Keep the baseline intact so you can revert if needed.

Data formats and interoperability
- The toolset uses widely accepted formats to ensure compatibility with common workflows:
  - MIDI data for score and instrument tracks
  - VST Expression data for articulation and dynamics
  - Audio data in standard formats used by Cubase projects
- Presets and templates are stored in a portable format that can be shared with teammates or across machines.
